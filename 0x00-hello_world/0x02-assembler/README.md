### 2-assembler (the script)
-	Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file
	- The C file name will be saved in the variable _$CFILE_
	- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension _.s_ instead of _.c_
		- Example: If the C file is _main.c_, the output file should be _main.s_
