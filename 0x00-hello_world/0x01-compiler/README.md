- Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link
	- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
	- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ```.o``` instead of ```.c```
		- Example: If the C file is ```main.c```, the output file should be ```main.o```
